RAFAEL IRIZZARY: In an earlier video, we saw that California

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,820
had the most murders of any state.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,870
But does this mean it is the most dangerous state?

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,660
What if it just has many, many more people than any other one?

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,060
Using the tools we have learned, we can very quickly

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,410
confirm that indeed, California has the largest population.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,500
We simply type murders$state and then ask which is the biggest state,

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,360
population-wise, using code.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,590
And we see that it's California.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,350
In fact, we can see how many people it has

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,850
by just looking at the maximum of the populations column.

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,700
With over 37 million inhabitants, it might

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,540
be unfair to compare California to other states.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,920
What we really should be computing is the murders per capita.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,120
Here, the powerful vector arithmetic capabilities of R come in handy.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,800
In R, arithmetic operations on vectors occur element-wise.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,630
What does this mean?

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,690
For a quick example, suppose we have height in inches.

20
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,400
We're going to add some heights to a heights object.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,250
Suppose you want to convert them to centimeters.

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,250
Note what happens when we multiply the object heights by the value 2.54.

23
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,510
We get back each element multiplied by 2.54.

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,060
They've been converted to centimeters.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,760
Similarly if for each of these measurements,

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,960
we want to compute how many inches taller or shorter than the average,

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,290
we can subtract the average from every entry.

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,450
Let's say the average is 69 inches.

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,920
Then we write the following code.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,750
Heights minus 69 will give us for each entry how much bigger or smaller

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,240
they are from 69.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,540
If we have two vectors of the same length,

33
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,370
these operations are even more powerful.

34
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,460
For example, if we have two vectors like this, they get added entry by entry.

35
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,580
And the same holds for other mathematical operations

36
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,790
such as multiplication, subtraction and division.

37
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:13,880
This implies that to compute the murder rate, murders for every 100,000 people,

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,900
we can simply type murder rate-- that's the object we're defining--

39
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,630
is the total divided by the population, multiplied by 100,000.

40
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,910
So the total for each state is going to be

41
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,500
divided by the population for each state, element-wise, one by one.

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,460
And then at the end, we multiply those values by 100,000

43
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,530
to get it in the right units.

44
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,260
Once we do this, we notice that California

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,900
is no longer near the top of the list.

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,470
We can use what we've learned to order the states by murder rate.

47
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,420
Here I'm going to look at the states ordered by murder rate, in this case,

48
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,610
in decreasing order.

49
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,480
And now we see that California is not even in the top 10.

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,750
The highest murder rate is in the District of Columbia,

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,090
the second one is in Louisiana, et cetera.

52
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,290
And California is only the 14th.

53
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:12,704
