RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In a previous video, we introduced for loops,
but it turns out that we rarely use them in R.
This is because there are usually more powerful ways to perform the same task.
But the concept is still important, so it's good that we covered for loops.
Functions that are typically used instead of for loops in R
are apply, sapply, tapply, and mapply.
These are part of what we call the apply family.
We do not cover these functions in this course,
but they are worth learning if you intend to go beyond this introduction.
Other functions that are widely used are split, cut, quantile, reduce,
identical, unique, and many others.
There are many ways you can learn about this.
And you should learn to use the web to find out about what they do
and when to use them.
