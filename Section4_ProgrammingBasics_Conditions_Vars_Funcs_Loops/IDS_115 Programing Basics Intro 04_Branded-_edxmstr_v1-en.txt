RAFAEL IRIZARRY: We teach R because it greatly
facilitates data analysis, the main topic of this series.
Coding in R, we can efficiently perform exploratory data analysis,
build data analysis pipelines, and prepare data visualizations
to communicate results.
However, R is not just a data analysis environment, but a programming
language.
Advanced R programmers can develop complex packages,
and even suggest ways to improve R itself.
But we do not cover advanced programming in this course.
However, in the next videos, we introduce three key programming
concepts--
conditional expressions, for-loops, and building functions.
These are not just key building blocks for advanced programming,
but often come in handy during data analysis.
