RAFAEL IRIZARRY: For many of the analyses we perform with dplyr
we will find it necessary to create data frames in R.
You can do this using the data.frame function.
Here's an example.
We're creating an object called grades.
We're adding names and the scores of exam_1 and exam_2.
You specify the column name and then the entry for that column name,
as we see here.
Now, be warned, by default, data.frame turns characters into factors.
For example, let's look at the class of grades$names.
It's a factor.
To avoid this, we use the rather cumbersome argument stringsAsFactors--
one word-- in the following way.
We rewrite the whole thing.
But at the end, we define this special argument,
stringsAsFactors equals FALSE.
And when we do it this way, now the characters
stay characters, as we can see by looking at the class of grades.names.
Now in this case, it is a character.
