RAFAEL IRIZARRY: We previously computed three summary statistics
using three different functions.
But, notice that we can obtain the min, median, and maximum with just one line
of code using the quantiles function.
For example, we can type quantiles x, c, 0, 0.5, and 1, and this returns
the minimum, the median, and the maximum of the vector x.
However, if we attempt to use a function that
returns two or more values, like this, we
see that summarize returns a table with three rows--
one for each outcome of the call of the function quantile.
If you want to have them in columns, as we did previously,
we need to write a function that returns a data frame rather than a vector.
We can do that by using the function command, like this.
We refine my quantile as a function, and then we
call the summarize function, like this.
