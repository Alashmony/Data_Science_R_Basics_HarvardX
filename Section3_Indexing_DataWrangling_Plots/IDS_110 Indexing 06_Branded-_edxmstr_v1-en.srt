RAFAEL IRIZARRY: R provides a powerful and convenient way of indexing vectors.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,520
We can, for example, subset a vector based on properties of another vector.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,940
We continue our US murders example to demonstrate

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,840
this powerful approach using the murder rates we have already calculated.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,960
All right, let's suppose you're moving from Italy where

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,410
according to the ABC News report we showed earlier, the murder

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,000
rate is only 0.71 per 100,000 people.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,920
You would prefer to move to a state with a similar murder rate or lower.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,610
To find these states, we're going to use a powerful feature of R,

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,670
and it's that we can use logicals to index vectors.

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,260
Furthermore, the principles of vector arithmetics that we've already

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,750
learned apply to logical operations.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,760
For example, if we compare a vector to a single number,

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,129
it actually performs the test for each entry.

16
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,420
Here's an example related to the question above.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,480
We're going to define index as the murder rate smaller than 0.71,

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,870
or, if we want to know if it's less or equal, we can use less than or equal.

19
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,420
Here's a result of this operation.

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,920
We can see the 51 entries are either false or true.

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,130
The entries that are true are the cases for which the murder

22
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,940
rate is smaller or equal than 0.71.

23
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,210
To see which states these are, we can leverage the fact

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,450
that vectors can be indexed with logicals.

25
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:47,790
So if we type murders$state and then index with the index object,

26
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,140
we get the answer.

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,481
It's Hawaii, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Vermont.

28
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:59,060
Another nice feature is that to count how many entries are true,

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,390
the function sum returns the sum of these entries.

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,690
This is because the logical vector gets coerced to numeric.

31
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,039
True turns into a 1.

32
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,290
False gets turned into a 0.

33
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,410
So when we sum them, we're basically counting the cases that are true.

34
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,160
Here's an example.

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,760
If we say sum(index), we get 5.

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,160
That's how many states have murder rates smaller than 0.71.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,470
All right, now suppose we like the mountains,

38
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,560
and we want to move to a safe state in the west region of the country.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,190
That's where the mountains are in the US.

40
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,520
We want the murder rate to be at most, 1.

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,850
So we want two different things to be true now.

42
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,260
Here, we can use the logical operators in R. And one of them

43
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,120
is the "&" sign, which makes two logicals true

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,360
only when they're both true.

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,890
So true and true is true, but true and false is false.

46
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,290
And false and false, of course, is false.

47
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,820
Knowing this, we can use the "&" to get a vector of logicals

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,080
and find out which states satisfy our two conditions.

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,300
Let's start by creating the two logical vectors representing our conditions.

50
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,610
We want the region to be west.

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,570
And we want the murder rate to be less than or equal to 1.

52
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,480
We can use the "&" to get a vector of logicals

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,260
and find out which states satisfy our two conditions.

54
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,980
We define index now as safe & west.

55
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,750
And that will only be true when both entries of those vectors are true.

56
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,410
Now we can see which states are both safe according to our definition,

57
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,940
and in the west.

58
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,480
The five states are Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming.

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,320
So now we have five states to pick for where we're going to move from Italy.

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,600
