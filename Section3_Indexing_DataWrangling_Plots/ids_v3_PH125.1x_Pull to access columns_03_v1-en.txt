RAFAEL IRIZARRY: Previously, we defined the data table US murder rate
using this code.
Note that this is just one number yet we are starting in a data frame.
You can see it by using the class function.
Since as most dplyr functions summarize always returns a data frame.
This might be problematic if you want to use the result with functions
that require numeric value.
To get numeric values or vectors, we can use the access or the dollar
sign or the dplyr pull function.
Here's an example of how we could use the pull function.
If we want to save the number directly with just one line of code,
we can do the whole operation like this.
We now see that the US murder rate object is now a numeric.
We can use the class function like this.
