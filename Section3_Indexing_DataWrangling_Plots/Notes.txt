Section 3 Overview
    Section 3 introduces the R commands and techniques that help you wrangle, analyze, and visualize data.

In Section 3.1, you will:
    Subset a vector based on properties of another vector. 
    Use multiple logical operators to index vectors.
    Extract the indices of vector elements satisfying one or more logical conditions. 
    Extract the indices of vector elements matching with another vector.
    Determine which elements in one vector are present in another vector. 

In Section 3.2, you will:
    Wrangle data tables using functions in the dplyr package. 
    Modify a data table by adding or changing columns. 
    Subset rows in a data table.
    Subset columns in a data table. 
    Perform a series of operations using the pipe operator. 
    Create data frames. 

In Section 3.3, you will:
    Plot data in scatter plots, box plots, and histograms. 

In Section 3.4, you will:
    Use summarize() to facilitate summarizing data in dplyr.
    Learn about the dot placeholder.
    Learn how to group and then summarize in dplyr.
    Learn how to sort data tables in dplyr.

In Section 3.5, you will:
    Learn how to subset and summarize data using data.table.
    Learn how to sort data frames using data.table.

logical operators:
    - We can use logicals to index vectors which returns an array with similar length with "true" in the field where the condition was met.
    - Using the function sum() on a logical vector returns the number of entries that are "true".
    - The logical operator “&” makes two logicals true only when they are both true.
    - logical operators are: less than <, less or eq <=, more than >, more or eq =>, equal ==, not eq !=, not !, or |, and &

Indexing Functions:
    - The function which() gives us the entries of a logical vector that are true.
    ```
        index <- which(murders$state == "Massachusetts")
        index
        murder_rate[index]
    ```
    >>> 1.802

    - The function match() looks for entries in a vector and returns the index needed to access them.
    ```
        index <- match(c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"), murders$state)
        index
    ```
    >>> 33, 10, 44
    ```
        murders$state[index]
        murder_rate[index]
    ```
    >>> "New York", "Florida", "Texas"
    >>> 2.668, 3.398, 3.201

    - We use the function %in% if we want to know whether or not each element of a first vector is in a second vector.
    ```
        x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
        y <- c("a", "d", "f")
        y %in% x
    ```
    >>> TRUE, TRUE, FALSE
    ```
        # to see if Boston, Dakota, and Washington are states
        c("Boston", "Dakota", "Washington") %in% murders$state
    ```
    >>> FALSE, FALSE, TRUE

Basic Data Wrangling:
    - To change a data table by adding a new column, or changing an existing one, we use the mutate() function.
    - To filter the data by subsetting rows, we use the function filter().
    - To subset the data by selecting specific columns, we use the select() function.
    - We can perform a series of operations by sending the results of one function to another function using the pipe operator, %>%.

Working with data manilpuation package (dplyr)
    - mutate() adds new columns, syntax -> mutate(dataset, new_var = calculation)
    - filter() filters the data with a condition as follows -> filter(dataset, condition)
    - select() select certain columns from the dataset -> select(dataset, column1, column2, column2)
    - %>% passes the result of a function to the next one, you won't need to add the argument which is the dataset anymore

Creating dataframes
    - Creating a data frame can be done as follows -> data.frame(column1 = c("v1", "v2"), column2 = c(1,2))
    - By default, data.frame() creates the string variables as factors, to disable it, set ```stringsAsFactors = FALSE```  in the arguments
    ```
    data.frame(column1 = c("v1", "v2"), column2 = c(1,2),  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    ```
    - nrow() counts the number of rows in a dataset

Key Points
    - We can create a simple scatterplot using the function plot().
    - Histograms are graphical summaries that give you a general overview of the types of values you have.  In R, they can be produced using the hist() function.
    - Boxplots provide a more compact summary of a distribution than a histogram and are more useful for comparing distributions. They can be produced using the boxplot() function.
    - Boxplot() is used as follows boxplot(numericColumn~Categorical, data = dataset)

Key Points
    - The quantile() function can be used to return the min, median, and max in a single line of code.
